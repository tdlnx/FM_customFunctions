FileMaker Custom Functions

You are free to use any of these custom functions in whatever projects you see fit. All of these functions will have a header similar to the one below listing the parameters expected, the purpose of the function, and any misc notes:

All of the functions in this repo are licensed using v3 of the Gnu General Public License where applicable*. The full license terms can be found in LICENSE.md

* Except for the virtual lists functions. Those were written by Jeremy Bante and I copied them here just so that all the functions were in one place. [https://github.com/jbante/FM-VirtualValueList] I also forked the repo just in case it's not available from the original source in the future.
