// Author: Travis Witt c.2020
// Purpose: Translate FileMaker error codes to human readable text.
// Parameters: errorCode
// Notes: There are quite a few of these functions available online but I wanted
//        to maintain my own because a lot of the others are outdated. As of
//        November 2020 this function is up to date with the error codes provided
//        by Claris. I split the errors into groups based on number mostly for
//        my own sanity when searching for a certain code later.
//
//        I've also included certain MacOS specific error codes and descriptions
//        which may or may not be useful. All of the MacOS specific codes have 
//        been labeled between "//======================" brackets just in case
//        anyone wants to remove them for some reason.
// ===
// Changelog:
// 11/09/2020 [Travis]: Created
// 11/09/2020 [Travis]: Added MacOS, Applescript, Apple Event, and Open Scripting
//                      Architecture error codes
// ===
